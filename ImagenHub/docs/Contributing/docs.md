# Improving The Documentation

We are looking for help in improving the documentation.

## Building the Docs locally

The easiest way to build the docs is to use the `docs/make_docs.sh` script.

Make sure that you are in the correct conda environment:
```shell
cd docs
./make_docs.sh
```

This script will build the docs and store it in `docs/_build`.
