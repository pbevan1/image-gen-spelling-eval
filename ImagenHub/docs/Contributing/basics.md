# The Basics
We believe that everyone can contribute and make a difference. Whether it's writing code 💻, fixing bugs 🐛, or simply sharing feedback 💬, your contributions are definitely welcome and appreciated 🙌

And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:
- Star the project
- Tweet about it
- Refer this project in your project's readme
- Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

## Fork and Pull Request

When contributing to the codebase of ImagenHub, the first step is to create a fork of the repository. Then, it’s best practice to create a separate branch for each new pull request (PR) you create. This can be done using:

```shell
git checkout -b name_of_your_branch
```

The main branch then simply has the role of being kept up to date with upstream. You can create PRs based on the main branch of your fork, but this will make things more complicated if you would then like to create additional PRs in the future.


## Each Pull Request point to an issue

We suggest using one pull-request for each issue. This makes changes clear and simple.

* Link each Pull Request to an issue: `- [ ] #issue_number`

### Commits across minimum files on each Pull Request

Since each Pull Request links to one issue, don’t change too many files at once. Keeping changes small makes it easier for others to check and understand. It also reduces mistakes and mix-ups. So, always keep it simple and focused.
